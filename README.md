# # Objective:
The idea of this application is use the Bored API to find activities to do when you are bored.<br />
The activites that you are going to find are related to the following types:<br />

• recreational<br />
• social<br />
• diy<br />
• charity<br />
• cooking<br />
• relaxation<br />
• music<br />

Those types are also the ones that you use to search an activity to do.<br />

You can save the activities that you like on the favourites page, and can also remove them later.<br />
To access the favourite page, all you need to do is click on the "favourite" button, on the top of the page.
